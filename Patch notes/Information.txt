For every patch there will be a note that will include every detail. 
This will be worked on and as I input information in the app I will delete patchnotes and when everything is gone I Will write..
 "Check!
Everything updated for patch X.X.X"

So its clear for me where I am with updating the app. 

After this I will update the Component "Footer" so it will include where this drafter is with updates.
