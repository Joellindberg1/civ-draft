New Features

    Modern Age Pacing and Balance
        We've made a number of changes to help the Modern Age last a bit longer so that players have more space to enjoy all the unique gameplay in that Age.
        Eliminating a player no longer adds Age Progress in Modern, and the amount of Age Progress added in Exploration has been halved so that Domination Victories are easier to achieve now.
        Modern Techs and Civic costs have been increased by roughly 25% overall, more heavily weighted on nodes deeper in the trees.
        We've made a number of changes around Railroad Tycoon gameplay:
            Factory Cost increased from 600 to 1400.
            Port Cost increased from 550 to 1200.
            Rail Station Cost increased from 650 to 1200.
            Coal Resource changed from 100% Production bonus towards Rail Stations to 10% Production bonus towards Rail Stations and Ports (the existing 100% bonus was not functioning as intended).
            Oil Resource now also gives a 10% Production bonus towards Factories.
        Your Military Advisor will now warn you if you don't have enough Commanders to retain all of your Units when an Age is ending.
        Map Generation has been improved and players can now choose between two Start Position options (Standard and Balanced) in Advanced Setup.
